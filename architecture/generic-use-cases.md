# Generic Use Cases

DLCs enable Bitcoin on-chain deposits for lending, trading and investing.

Currently we at DLC.Link are focused singularly on creating the most simple, secure, trustless Bitcoin to EVM bridge on the market. Our current solution is designed purely for this goal. However the function of a DLC Attestor can easily be broadened to support arbitrary functions between Bitcoin and smart contract chains. Below are a few use cases we're considering for the future.\


**CeFi Finance and Settlement**

Credit Trading Desks: Integration allows the custodian to provide borrowing and other financial services to their self-custodied Bitcoin clients.

Prime Brokers: Integration enables the ability to escrow and conditionally move native Bitcoin with instant finality and without requiring triparty custody.

Digital Asset Custodians: Integration allows the custodian to provide borrowing and other financial services to miners and other self-custodied Bitcoin clients.

Exchanges and OTC Desks: By facilitating trades via escrow, [DLC.Link](http://dlc.link) provides immediate Bitcoin finality (vs. 24-48 hour execution times where intermediaries are involved) and eliminates slippage on trades by facilitating escrow (where several percentages can cost millions).&#x20;

Payments: Lock BTC to be used in a Lightning transaction. Enable Bitcoin wallets to have a refund transaction.\


**DeFi Protocols**

DeFi Lend/Borrow Protocols: Integration provides the ability to provide a soft-pegged stablecoin or loan backed by Bitcoin collateral secured on-chain.

NFTFi Lending Marketplaces: Borrow stablecoin against native Bitcoin.

Cross-Chain Protocols: Integration enables application developers to build smart contracts that move native Bitcoin.

Ordinals trading protocols: Integration enables ordinals to be traded and borrowed against in OpenSea and other smart contract NFT marketplaces.

Miners: Enable Bitcoin hashrate derivatives, allowing conditional BTC mining reward payouts either on Bitcoin or the Lightning Network.
