# Installation and Setup

DLC.Link has libraries allowing for simple and fast configuration of DLCs in your product / smart contracts. Depending on what type of product you're integrating into, we have a different library build just for you.

If you simply want to support Native BTC by leveraging our 721 compatible NFT, then no smart-contract customization is necessary. Please see the following link for more information: [https://docs.dlc.link/use-cases/escrow-services](https://docs.dlc.link/use-cases/escrow-services)
