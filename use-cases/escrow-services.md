# Minting a Collateralized Bitcoin NFT

The user navigates to a Bitcoin vaulting application. After connecting their web3 wallet, they specify how much Bitcoin will be placed into a DLC vault and clicks create. This sends a transaction from their web3 wallet and notifies the DLC.Link platform. Our platform sends the request to a DLC.Link-enabled wallet to arrange the Bitcoin escrow between the user and a registered vault custodian. Once the transaction is confirmed, the custodian mints an NFT corresponding to the amount the user locked up. The NFT is sent to the user and can be seen in their wallet.
