# Overview

Although Bitcoin is the largest digital asset, it thus far cannot be used in DeFi without first being transferred to a custodian or a bridge. However, custodian failures and bridge hacks have led to over $140Bn in losses.

[DLC.Link](http://dlc.link/) utilizes the concepts of Discreet Log Contracts, invented at MIT by the co-creator of the Lightning Network, to provide a trustless bridge to DeFi on Ethereum without centralizing or pooling assets.&#x20;

We will be launching dlcBTC, a non-custodial wrapped Bitcoin, in April 2024.

Billions of dollars in Bitcoin capital is waiting to be used in smart contracts for lending, hedging, and trading.
