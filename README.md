# DLC.Link - Documentation

{% hint style="info" %}
Billions of dollars in Bitcoin capital is waiting to be used in smart contracts for lending, hedging, and trading.
{% endhint %}

Although Bitcoin is the largest digital asset, it does not support smart contracts. Today, it’s not possible to take a loan on Bitcoin without first transferring it to a custodian or a bridge. Custodian failures and bridge hacks, however, have led to over $140Bn in losses to date.

[DLC.link](http://dlc.link) implements an MIT invention ([discreet-log-contracts.md](additional-resources/discreet-log-contracts.md "mention")) that makes it easy for app developers to integrate native Bitcoin. Their platform locks Bitcoin into on-chain escrow, from where it can be controlled by Ethereum and other smart contract chains. This “trustless bridge” enables lending, trading, derivatives and more.
