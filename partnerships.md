# Partnerships

## Chainlink

[Chainlink](https://chain.link/) is the predominant industry standard to securely connect smart contracts with off-chain data and services. DLC.Link was awarded a Chainlink Community Grant to develop open-source infrastructure for bridging data from Chainlink oracles to DLCs on the Bitcoin network.

## Xverse Wallet

[Xverse](http://www.xverse.app/) is the first production wallet to integrate DLC.link’s signing technology. Going forward, Xverse can be used in applications on any blockchain that can support DLC functionality. We’re excited about the next chapter in Bitcoin’s evolution as a safe, censorship-resistant asset that can now be used in advanced financial applications.
