# dlcBTC Testnet Access

Visit [DLC.Link dlcBTC Website](https://dev-mint.dlc.link/) to access the Mint/Redeem website. This platform allows you to mint dlcBTC tokens using BTC collateral, which will be securely locked into a DLC (Discreet Log Contract). To use the website, ensure you have a Metamask Wallet for Ethereum actions and a Leather Wallet for DLC signing.

For expedited testing, we provide a  regtest Bitcoin network, with fast \~30 second block times. To connect, prior to initiating the minting process, choose ‘add a new network’ in your Leather Wallet and enter the following details:

* Name: DLC.Link
* Mode: Regtest
* Stacks API URL: No change required
* Bitcoin API URL: [https://devnet.dlc.link/electrs](https://devnet.dlc.link/electrs)
* Key: dlc

\
To obtain BTC on our regtest chain, please visit the Development channel in our [Discord ](https://discord.gg/75RKvq5t)Server and perform the following action:

/sendbtc \[address: your regtest bitcoin address] \[amount: the amount you would like to receive, between 1 and 3]

Once the setup is complete, log in with your Metamask account on the website and you can begin the dlcBTC minting process.

The instructions provided on the page will lead you through the complete process of both the mint and redeem flows for dlcBTCs.
